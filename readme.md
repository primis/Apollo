###The Apollo Project
_(C) 2013 - 2016 Primis Computers (Nick Sargente et al)_

Requirements:
=================================================
This is a kernel project for x86 Hardware. Current compilation needs:
* GNU Make (Or Compatible)
* NASM, The Netwide Assembler
* GCC

The kernel is written in X86-Assembly and ANSI-C. We are currently working
on making it as portable as possible.

This software is licensed under the MIT License.
(see License)

Supported Architectures:
=================================================
Currently, only IBM-PC Compatible 486+ PC's are targeted, however this
will change with time.

Notable Features to Consider:
=================================================
This kernel is in development, and is therefore subject to major changes.
The API is in a state of flux. If developing applications, stick to
functions from the standard c library. All others may be depreciated /
removed without notice.

History:
=================================================
This kernel descends from several failed kernel projects;
* ScorchOS; by Bob Moss and Nicholas Sargente. Circa 2010
* Mercury/SaturnOS; by Brandon Cornell and Nicholas Sargente. Circa 2012
* Apollo Kernel Project; Circa 2009-2011. Nicholas Sargente.

This kernel takes base code from Bkerndev and James Molloy's Tutorials:
